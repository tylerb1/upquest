Medium Fidelity Prototype README

This solution, provided by UpQuest, is a iPad application for teacher to create, manage, and visualize
formative assessments given to students over time. Details on running the demo are below.

Tools used to run
	Marvel App is used to create an interactive interface to run this demo. The application
	is embedded in the current web page.

Limitation
	The current implementation does not actually implement any of the back end functionality
	as this is only a front end visualization. Such back end functionality include
		- Quiz searches
		- Student scores
	We hard coded these into the demo to show how it would look like in a particular instance
